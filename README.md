# Project Proposal

## Vision

At Mind Garden, our mission is to cultivate a space where personal growth and mindfulness flourish through intuitive, data-driven tools. We empower users to nurture healthy habits, reflect deeply, and unlock their potential by seamlessly integrating habit tracking, journaling, and productivity tools into one cohesive experience.

## Summary

Building the habit of self-improvement through journaling can be tough, but Mind Garden is here to help. Mind Garden is a comprehensive space for bettering your mental well-being. It is somewhere to journal, record daily tasks, and track habits to understand how they affect the user’s mental health. The goal of Mind Garden is to simplify the process of consistent journaling and habit tracking. We hope the app gives the user insights into their patterns and helps them achieve their personal goals.

Long-term, we hope that Mind Garden supports the younger generation through their mental health journey. To address the challenge of staying consistent with journaling and habit tracking, we are integrating features like notifications, streaks, and badges. Along with that, we want our user experience to be simple and effective while ensuring all essential information is easily accessible.

We are looking to see a consistent growth of 10% each month. Since consistency is important when it comes to personal development, we hope to see at least 30% of our users use the app daily. By reaching these goals, we can determine that our app was successful.

## Stakeholders

Mind Garden is designed for individuals who want to cultivate mindfulness, track their habits, and enhance personal growth. While young adults looking to build a journaling habit are a key audience, the platform is suitable for:

- **Students & Professionals** – Those looking to manage their daily tasks, reflect on their progress, and maintain healthy habits.
- **Productivity Seekers** – People who want to optimize their routines, set goals, and track their achievements through habit tracking and AI-powered task management.
- **Coaches & Therapists** – Professionals who encourage journaling and habit-building as part of mental health or life coaching practices.

Of course, Mind Garden is suitable to any age, though, if they have a genuine interest in personal development.

## Main Features

Our core features for Mind Garden are the ability to create an account, voice-made daily tasks, daily data intake, a journal entry system, data visualization, and achievement progress tracking.

- **Create an account:** The user should have the ability to create an account, so the data can follow the user to whatever device they wish to use.
- **Voice-made daily tasks:** At the start of each day, the user can record themselves discussing what needs to be accomplished that day. Mind Garden will then narrow the information down into a simple bullet point list to ensure the user stays on track for the day.
- **Daily data intake:** At the end of each day, the user will be expected to input data relating to the habits they wish to track. This can be something like how much water they drank or how much sleep they got the night prior.
- **Journal entry system:** Along with the daily data intake, the user will be prompted to write in their digital journal. Here, they can either express their feelings freely or use the provided guided questions.
- **Data visualization:** The data from the daily input and journal entries can then be used for data visualization where the user can view their habit patterns and how that might relate to their mood. Summaries from both the daily input and journal entries will be made possible using AI.
- **Achievement progress tracking:** As the user uses Mind Garden, they can achieve things like badges and streaks. For example, if the user writes in their journal every day for 20 days, they can achieve a badge to reward their consistency. The user will also have a streak of 20 days. \*\*\*\*By implementing badges and streaks, we are hoping to motivate the user to continue to use the application. We think consistency is important for self-improvement.

Our application can respond to 20 users with a total of 200 requests per minute concurrently.

## Technologies

For this project, we are leveraging modern technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

- **Programming Language & Framework**
  - We chose **TypeScript** for its type safety, which helps reduce bugs and improve code reliability.
  - Our framework of choice is **Next.js**, which will be used for both the front-end user interface and back-end server-side logic.
- **Database & Authentication**
  - We are using **Supabase**, a **PostgreSQL**-based solution, due to its scalability, generous free tier, and built-in authentication via **Supabase Auth**, which simplifies user authentication and management.
- **AI Integration**
  - We plan to integrate AI into our project using a local **LLM (Llama)** with an API developed in-house to enhance our features.
- **Hosting & Infrastructure**
  - For hosting, we are evaluating **Microsoft Azure** and **AWS** to determine the best fit for our needs.
  - **Docker** will be used for containerization, ensuring a seamless deployment process.
  - **GitHub Actions** will handle CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.
- **Code Quality & Standards**
  - We will enforce consistent coding standards using **ESLint**, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

## User Stories

1. **Account Creation & Management**
   - As a user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can keep my records.
     - On a registration page, when a user enters a valid email address, password, and any required fields, and clicks "Sign Up", the account is created, and the user is redirected to the welcome page/dashboard. When the user enters an already registered email address and submits the form, the system displays an error message stating the email is already in use.
   - As a user, I want to be able to access my account so that I can view any records I made.
     - When the user has entered their registered email and password and the credentials are correct, the user is logged in and redirected to the dashboard. When the user enters incorrect credentials and the login form is submitted the system displays an error message indicating an incorrect email or password.
   - As a user, I want to be able to reset my password without logging in so that even if I forget my password I can still recover my account.
     - When the user clicks on "Forgot Password" from the login page and the user provides their registered email address, the system sends a password reset email with a unique link to that address. When the user enters and confirms a new password and the new password meets the system's security requirements, the password is updated, and the user is redirected to the login page with a success message.
   - As a user, I want to be able to change the credentials of my account so that in case my information changes I can correct it.
     - When the user is logged in and navigates to the account settings and requests to update email, password, or etc., the system prompts the user to enter the current password for verification. When the user enters new credentials and submits the changes, the system updates the credentials and displays a success message.
   - As a user, I want to be able to delete my account so that all records that I've made are deleted.
     - When the user is logged in and navigates to the account settings and clicks on "Delete Account", the system should ask for confirmation to ensure they want to permanently delete the account. If the user confirms the deletion request, the account and all associated data are permanently deleted from the system. After deletion, the user is logged out and redirected to the homepage. A confirmation email is sent to the user notifying them that their account has been deleted.
2. **Daily Data Intake**
   - As a user, I want to be able to track multiple habits so that I can monitor my progress and goals.

3. **Journal Entry System**
   - As a user, I want to create a journal entry so that I can document my thoughts throughout the day.
     - Given that I am a logged-in user, when I am on the homepage then the system shows me a journal entry portion of the screen and when I click create new entry then the system shows me an empty page that I can write in.
   - As a user, I want guidance for my journal entry in the form of prompts so that my ideas are better organized.
     - Given that I am a logged-in user already in the new journal entry, when I click on the options button and I click on guided journaling then I can see a prompt for me to write about above the empty page.
   - As a user, I want to be able to view my past journal entries so that I can reflect on my progress.
     - Given that I am a logged-in user, when I am on the homepage then the system shows me a journal entry portion of the screen and when I click view past journals then the system shows me all of my past journal entries with their dates.
   - As a user, I want to be able to edit my journal entry so that I can update my thoughts throughout the day.
     - Given that I am a logged-in user and already viewing my past journal entries, when I click on the edit button next to the journal entry then the system opens up that journal entry with text already in it and allows me to make changes.
   - As a user, I want to be able to delete my journal entry so that I can remove any content I do not want anymore.
